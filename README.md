# Lab 8: API Explanation: SpaceX API

**Author:** Brendan Dindial

For this project, I chose the SpaceX API, which provides real-time information on SpaceX launches, rockets, capsules, and more. This API is a powerful tool for accessing up-to-date data on various SpaceX missions, from upcoming launches to historical ones.

I have always been fascinated by space exploration, and SpaceX plays a major role in advancing space technology. The SpaceX API provides detailed information on their latest and past launches, making it an excellent way to stay informed about space achievements.

Additionally, this API is easy to use, requires no authentication, and offers various endpoints for different types of data, making it flexible for building a web page with real-time launch data.

With this API, I was able to fetch the latest launch information, including details such as the launch name, flight number, launch date, success status, and a mission patch image. Presenting this data on a web page is a way to visually highlight SpaceX's most recent contributions to space exploration, making it accessible and engaging for users.
